# Meditrina Bounty and Challenges

Coding challenges and bounties for the Meditrina clinic management project.

## What is Meditrina

Meditrina is a clinic management suite that targets the the mental health sector. The goal of the application is to give physicians and medical professionals tools that reduce their administrative burdens and to aid in the improvement of patients' health. These solutions have real world benefit.

# Structure

Each challenge will be listed separately under an individual directory. Inside that directory will be a README file with the specific rules for each challenge or bounty. A start date will be added to the README file to that the participants have an idea of the time range. A suggest end time is also provided.

If a programmer finds that he outclasses these solutions he may make an offer after the bounty is paid out and we will consider adding it to our codebase.

Some of these submissions will be moved into an open source repository that we will use internally to our code base and the programmer is added as a contributor. These are real world problems we hope to offer up for the community.

Complete the project with whatever language is appropriate. Add your script to the same directory named YOUR_USERNAME.EXT - for example user solvire would add a file named solvire.py to the challenge directory.

Leave all documentation as code comments in the script docblocks.
